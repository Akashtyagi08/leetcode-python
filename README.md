# Leetcode Python Solution
1. This is my Python solution on Leetcode. The question is at `problems/the-file-name/`. For example, `merge-sorted-array.py`'s question is at `https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-sorted-array/`.

2. I really take time tried to make the best solution or explaination. 
Because I wanted to help others like me. 
If you like my answer, a star on GitHub means a lot to me.

# Resources
These are the interview resources I personally used and only if it is really helpful I will put it here.

## Overall Mindset
Haveing a right mindset is the most important one. It keeps you going when you are tired after work. Studying when everyone else are out having fun. Reminding you that your goals are not going to come easy, it takes time, self-discipline, mental and physical toughness...

This is a speech from Sean Lee on "How to Get a Job at the Big 4". I highly recommend this because it gives me the right mindset on how to put in the work.
